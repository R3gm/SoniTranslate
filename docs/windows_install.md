## Install Locally Windows

### Before You Start

Before you start installing and using SoniTranslate, there are a few things you need to do:

1. Install Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools, MSVC and Windows 10 SDK:

    * Go to the [Visual Studio downloads page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/); Or maybe you already have **Visual Studio Installer**? Open it. If you have it already click modify.
    * Download and install the "Build Tools for Visual Studio" if you don't have it.
    * During installation, under "Workloads", select "C++ build tools" and ensure the latest versions of "MSVCv142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools" and "Windows 10 SDK"  are selected ("Windows 11 SDK" if you are using Windows 11); OR go to individual components and find those two listed.
    * Complete the installation.

2. Verify the NVIDIA driver on Windows using the command line:

    * **Open Command Prompt:** Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, then press `Enter`.

    * **Type the command:** `nvidia-smi` and press `Enter`.

    * **Look for "CUDA Version"** in the output.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| NVIDIA-SMI 522.25       Driver Version: 522.25       CUDA Version: 11.8     |
|-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
```

3. If you see that your CUDA version is less than 11.8, you should update your NVIDIA driver. Visit the NVIDIA website's driver download page (https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) and enter your graphics card information.

4. Accept the license agreement for using Pyannote. You need to have an account on Hugging Face and `accept the license to use the models`: https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization and https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation
5. Create a [huggingface token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). Hugging Face is a natural language processing platform that provides access to state-of-the-art models and tools. You will need to create a token in order to use some of the automatic model download features in SoniTranslate. Follow the instructions on the Hugging Face website to create a token. When you are creating the new Access Token in Hugging Face, make sure to tick "Read access to contents of all public gated repos you can access".
6. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/). Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of Python and R. It includes a package manager called conda that makes it easy to install and manage Python environments and packages. Follow the instructions on the Anaconda website to download and install Anaconda on your system.
7. Install Git for your system. Git is a version control system that helps you track changes to your code and collaborate with other developers. You can install Git with Anaconda by running `conda install -c anaconda git -y` in your terminal (Do this after step 1 in the following section.). If you have trouble installing Git via Anaconda, you can use the following link instead:
   - [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

Once you have completed these steps, you will be ready to install SoniTranslate.

### Getting Started

To install SoniTranslate, follow these steps:

1. Create a suitable anaconda environment for SoniTranslate and activate it:

```
conda create -n sonitr python=3.10 -y
conda activate sonitr
python -m pip install pip==23.1.2 Setuptools==80.6.0
```

2. Clone this github repository and navigate to it:
```
git clone https://github.com/r3gm/SoniTranslate.git
cd SoniTranslate
```
3. Install CUDA Toolkit 11.8.0

```
conda install -c "nvidia/label/cuda-11.8.0" cuda-toolkit -y
```

4. Install PyTorch using conda
```
conda install pytorch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia -y
```

5. Install required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements_base.txt -v
pip install -r requirements_extra.txt -v
pip install onnxruntime-gpu
```

6. Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). FFmpeg is a free software project that produces libraries and programs for handling multimedia data. You will need it to process audio and video files. You can install ffmpeg with Anaconda by running `conda install -y ffmpeg` in your terminal (recommended). If you have trouble installing ffmpeg via Anaconda, you can use the following link instead: (https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html). Once it is installed, make sure it is in your PATH by running `ffmpeg -h` in your terminal. If you don't get an error message, you're good to go.

7. Optional install:

After installing FFmpeg, you can install these optional packages.

[Coqui XTTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) is a text-to-speech (TTS) model that lets you generate realistic voices in different languages. It can clone voices with just a short audio clip, even speak in a different language! It's like having a personal voice mimic for any text you need spoken.

```
pip install -q -r requirements_xtts.txt
pip install -q TTS==0.21.1  --no-deps
```

[Piper TTS](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) is a fast, local neural text to speech system that sounds great and is optimized for the Raspberry Pi 4. Piper is used in a variety of projects. Voices are trained with VITS and exported to the onnxruntime.

ðŸš§ For Windows users, it's important to note that the Python module piper-tts is not fully supported on this operating system. While it works smoothly on Linux, Windows compatibility is currently experimental. If you still wish to install it on Windows, you can follow this experimental method:

```
pip install https://github.com/R3gm/piper-phonemize/releases/download/1.2.0/piper_phonemize-1.2.0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl
pip install sherpa-onnx==1.9.12
pip install piper-tts==1.2.0 --no-deps
```

8. Setting your [Hugging Face token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) as an environment variable in quotes:

```
conda env config vars set YOUR_HF_TOKEN="YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN_HERE"
conda deactivate
```

### Running SoniTranslate

To run SoniTranslate locally, make sure the `sonitr` conda environment is active:

```
conda activate sonitr
```

Then navigate to the `SoniTranslate` folder and run either the `app_rvc.py`

```
python app_rvc.py
```
When the `local URL` `http://127.0.0.1:7860` is displayed in the terminal, simply open this URL in your web browser to access the SoniTranslate interface.

### Stop and close SoniTranslate.

In most environments, you can stop the execution by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal where you launched the script `app_rvc.py`. This will interrupt the program and stop the Gradio app.
To deactivate the Conda environment, you can use the following command:

```
conda deactivate
```

This will deactivate the currently active Conda environment sonitr, and you'll return to the base environment or the global Python environment.

### Starting Over

If you need to start over from scratch, you can delete the `SoniTranslate` folder and remove the `sonitr` conda environment with the following set of commands:

```
conda deactivate
conda env remove -n sonitr
```

With the `sonitr` environment removed, you can start over with a fresh installation.

### Notes
-  To use OpenAI's GPT API for translation, set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable in quotes:

```
conda activate sonitr
conda env config vars set OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
conda deactivate
```

- Alternatively, you can install the CUDA Toolkit 11.8.0  directly on your system [CUDA Toolkit 11.8.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive).
